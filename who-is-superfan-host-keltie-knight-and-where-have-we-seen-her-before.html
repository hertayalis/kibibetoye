LadyGang is a weekly comedy podcast hosted by Knight, Jac Vanek, and Becca Tobin in which the ladies discuss female-centric topics to reassure women that they’re not on their own. “Are you afraid to be alone with your own thoughts? Would you rather hear stories and conversations from three idiots stumbling through womanhood? Well, you’re in the right place!” the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast description</a> reads.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>The ultra-successful podcast was nominated for a People’s Choice Award and even led to an E! television show called LadyGang. Knight, along with her podcast co-hosts, released their first book together, Act Like a Lady: Questionable Advice, Ridiculous Opinions, and Humiliating Tales from Three Undignified Women, which became a New York Times bestseller. The three women followed that up with Lady Secrets: Real, Raw, and Ridiculous Confessions of Womanhood.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is Superfan?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by KELTIE (@keltie)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>Superfan is a new CBS series that premiered on August 9 and will span six hour-long episodes. Hosted by Knight and Burleson, the show will see fans compete in several rounds of trivia about their favorite musical artist to win the title of superfan and a major prize. Each episode will focus on a different star, and the first season includes Gloria Estefan, Pitbull, Shania Twain, and LL Cool J.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>In addition to hosting duties alongside Burleson, Knight is also a co-creator of the show and an executive producer. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> ahead of the show’s premiere, Knight said it “has been the most rewarding time of my life” to create and host the show.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=818 data-injectable=true>“What was so funny is that when we got down to who would want to be my co-host for the show, the name that would always come up — and has always come up when I’m auditioning or up for anything — is like, ‘Who is the new Ryan Seacrest?’” Knight recounted to the publication. “I literally would always look around in the rooms of people, and I’d be like, ‘It’s me! It’s me. I’m the new Ryan Seacrest!’ Like, if you are looking for a man, you’re wrong because the new Ryan Seacrest is a woman.”</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>Knight explained that Seacrest was a big inspiration to her and joked, “I am in my Ryan Seacrest era — I’m at E! News, I’m creating shows, I have a hit podcast, which is kind of like radio-ish. But honestly, creating the show has been scary and terrifying, and so rewarding.”</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>She also expanded on her idea for Superfan, as she explained that she doesn’t have any musical skills. However, Knight explained that she always loved the music business and wanted to be involved somehow. “This has been in my world for such a long time,” she continued. “There’s an art to the fan. And being a fan is my talent. I can’t sing. I can’t do fire like on America’s Got Talent, but being a fan is my life’s calling.”</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>For not having any musical talent, Knight does have a lot of connections in the music industry as she also was a backup dancer for Beyoncé and Taylor Swift and spent several seasons with the Radio City Rockettes. Knight has also worked as a cheerleader for the New York Knicks. Knight’s husband Chris Knight is also in the industry as he is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GM of artist management</a> at Jay-Z’s entertainment agency Roc Nation.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is Keltie Knight’s Superfan co-host?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by CBS Mornings (@cbsmornings)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>Knight is sharing co-hosting duties with Nate Burleson, himself a very recognizable figure with CBS, especially CBS Sports. Burleson co-hosts CBS Mornings and is an analyst for CBS Sports’ NFL pre-game, halftime, and post-game show.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>Burleson is a former NFL player with an 11-year career in the league as a wide receiver with the Minnesota Vikings, Seattle Seahawks, and Detroit Lions. He also launched his own clothing line, Lionblood Clothing.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Interestingly enough, Burleson and Knight were both born in the province of Alberta, Canada. Burleson was born in Calgary, but his family moved to Seattle, Washington, when he was young. Knight was born and raised in Edmonton and moved to the U.S. as a teenager to pursue her dancing career.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>Knight currently lives in Los Angeles with her husband and their dog. The couple renewed their vows six years into their marriage and 10 years into their relationship on Dec. 28, 2019. The ceremony came at the end of a difficult year for the television host as she revealed that she suffered a “devastating” miscarriage.</p><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>“2019 gave us a year of wonderful abundance for which we are incredibly grateful,” Knight told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People </a>back in 2020. “It also gave us a sick parent, never-ending upheaval of our home during filming and remodeling, living in separate cities for our careers, a devastating miscarriage that we struggled to keep private that was followed almost instantly by the gut-wrenching news that TV focus groups for our LadyGang television show found me unrelatable because I wasn’t a mother.”</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>While speaking with Variety, Knight revealed that there have already been conversations about a second season of Superfan. While the show hasn’t been greenlit for a reprise yet, Knight said she already has a wish list of celebrity guests – which includes Nicki Minaj and Harry Styles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahpmaho2LAtrzEq52apl2dvLTAjKScpayZmnqsusign61lkaOxbsPHnqmeZZiWw6Z51p5krJ2Vo3qpsdFmmZ6en6eycA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-superfan-host-keltie-knight-and-where-have-we-seen-her-before.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-superfan-host-keltie-knight-and-where-have-we-seen-her-before.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-superfan-host-keltie-knight-and-where-have-we-seen-her-before.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-superfan-host-keltie-knight-and-where-have-we-seen-her-before.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-superfan-host-keltie-knight-and-where-have-we-seen-her-before.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-superfan-host-keltie-knight-and-where-have-we-seen-her-before.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ces-2020-asus-unveils-rog-z11-mini-itx-chassis-for-gamers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ces-2020-asus-unveils-rog-z11-mini-itx-chassis-for-gamers.html>ASUS Unveils ROG Z11 Mini ITX Chassis For Gamers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tony-hale-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html>Tony Hale | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tony-hale-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
