Blake also allegedly ran straight at Lewis, 41, before he began shooting from his property.</p><p>Police relied on footage from other homes on the block, and in an arrest warrant detailed how Blake pleaded for his life after he was shot.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Flowers are secured to a pole as a memorial to Karon Blake, 13, on the corner of Quincy Street NE and Michigan Avenue NE in the Brookland neighborhood of Washington. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>“The decedent (Blake) can then be heard yelling, ‘I am sorry’ numerous times, followed by ‘Please don’t’ and ‘No’ numerous times. The decedent yells, ‘I am a kid’ and ‘I am only 12’ numerous times,” the warrant states.</p><p>Metropolitan Police Department chief Robert&nbsp;Contee said the weeks-long probe took the required time necessary.</p><p>“There was somewhat of a self-defense claim that needed to be overcome,” Contee said.</p><p>Lewis’ attorney Lee Smith said his client was innocent.</p><p>“While this is certainly a tragedy, once all the facts are heard, I believe the jury will find that there was no crime here,” Smith said in a statement.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Metropolitan Police Department chief Robert&nbsp;Contee talks during a press conference. <span class=credit>NBC News 4</span></figure><p>The footage has yet to be released, but the warrant says it shows Blake and others leaving what was a stolen car and breaking into other parked cars in the neighborhood. Contee said the youths were peering into cars with flashlights and going into them.</p><p>Lewis is charged with firing first at Blake while he was sitting inside the stolen car. In the confusion from that first shot, Blake apparently ran straight at Lewis before he was fatally wounded, police said.</p><p>“The first shot was fired … at someone sitting in a vehicle who wasn’t an immediate threat,” Contee said Tuesday. Once the first shot went off, when Lewis was not under personal threat was, is “where things really unraveled” that led to Blake’s death, Contee said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Homicide detectives search for evidence and speak with residents on Quincy Street in Washington, D.C. on January 12, 2023, nearly one week after a district government employee fatally shot Karon Blake. <span class=credit>Associated Press</span></figure><p>“I don’t know if (Blake) knew that Mr. Lewis was standing where he was standing,” Contee said as he encouraged other teens with Blake that night to come forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Lewis was held without bail until a court appearance on Feb. 13.</p><p>With Post wires</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmbGlfn660u81mo56vmah6pLTAq56enF2eu26%2Fx6imraGenHqlscCtn2anlmJ%2BdHnYnpirZZ%2BhsW63wKump2WSoa6ssY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjason-lewis-charged-in-shooting-death-of-13-year-old-karon-blake.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjason-lewis-charged-in-shooting-death-of-13-year-old-karon-blake.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjason-lewis-charged-in-shooting-death-of-13-year-old-karon-blake.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjason-lewis-charged-in-shooting-death-of-13-year-old-karon-blake.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjason-lewis-charged-in-shooting-death-of-13-year-old-karon-blake.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjason-lewis-charged-in-shooting-death-of-13-year-old-karon-blake.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-asus-rog-strix-g15-g513qy-review-amd-advantage.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-asus-rog-strix-g15-g513qy-review-amd-advantage.html>GPU Performance - The ASUS ROG Strix G15 (G513QY) Review: Embracing AMD's Advantage</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./americanexperience.html>Candy Land | American Experience | Official Site</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./americanexperience.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
