Cocktail? Formal? Black-tie? Deciphering this can be a headache. But that’s where we come in. Not only do we decode everything for you (see here), we also uncovered the perfect dress for each type of wedding with the help of a few fashion experts. And best of all, we found the ones that actually feel comfortable, on top of looking good because as Kate Bellman, women’s managing fashion editor at Nordstrom puts it, “It's essential to find one you'll feel comfortable in for several hours, particularly one that's easy to both dance and dine in.” She recommends looking for lightweight, breathable fabrics, especially if you're attending an outdoor wedding or one in an older venue that may not have the luxuries of modern-day air conditioning.” So without further ado, read on for the wedding guest dresses you’ll actually want to wear (again and again).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-reformation-frankie-silk-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Frankie Silk Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KUGB49Szy3YrvMbj3Cp6qqz0vII=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation-frankie-silk-dress-blur-91b4acf23d0b49049526f31cf1246341.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a classic fitted silhouette sold in solids and patterns.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It only goes up to a size 12.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’d be remiss not to mention <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Reformation's fashion</a> — it's the quintessential brand for finding wedding guest attire. As NYC-based fashion stylist Audree Kate López puts it, the dainty slip-inspired silhouettes never go out of style and can easily be accessorized up or down — and with how versatile they tend to be, we wouldn’t blame you for wearing them to more than one event. We specifically love the Frankie Silk Dress, which features a fitted silhouette with a square neckline outlined by ultra-thin straps. The smocked back ensures a more comfortable fit, while the high slit on the skirt gives your legs more freedom (for dancing, we assume). The dress comes in nine different colors, too, but López recommends picking one that can be worn year-round — rather than the ditsy florals that belong in the warmer seasons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silk |<strong> Colors: </strong>10<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>0–12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-lulus-remarkable-entrance-emerald-green-floral-print-satin-midi-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lulus Remarkable Entrance Emerald Green Floral Print Satin Midi Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lulus Remarkable Entrance Emerald Green Floral Print Satin Midi Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rRS5xNtm5oUACIdrz7WB9LowQOc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lulus-remarkable-entrance-emerald-green-floral-print-satin-midi-dress-a4e5201a2aaf4705a19446aa213be649.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lulus&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a chic, Reformation-esque silhouette for a fraction of the price.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The top fits snugly on larger chests.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With how much money people already spend to attend a wedding, we can’t blame you for wanting to save a bit on your outfit. That’s where Lulus comes in. We’re fond of this midi dress because of the flirty patterns it comes in, but it also looks stunning on lots of different body types, thanks to the neckline, fitted bodice, and gathered waist that flows in a midi skirt with a front slit. While it may be made of polyester, its sheen makes it look quite similar to the cult-favorite silk dresses Reformation offers, albeit for a quarter of the price. Those who wear a larger cup size might need to size up because the bodice does fit snugly, though. But once you find the right size, you’ll love how it fits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester |<strong> Colors: </strong>5<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-taller-marmo-ubud-one-shoulder-feather-trimmed-crepe-maxi-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Taller Marmo Feather-Trimmed Crepe Maxi Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Taller Marmo Ubud One-Shoulder Feather-Trimmed Crepe Maxi Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xceXhjwelEDk5BnaIw_WCnMB7_s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/taller-marmo-ubud-feather-trimmed-gown--65a3f029669342d79d8d3f037d873899.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>My Theresa</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a show-stopping silhouette that’s comfortable, too.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s dry-clean only.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When Sofia Richie married Elliott Grainge in April at what many consider to be the wedding of the year, the couple’s nuptials — and Sofia’s style and that of her guests — dominated headlines for months, and continue to inspire fashion trends. As such, López says that if you’re looking to splurge on your wedding guest dress, the Taller Marmo One-Shoulder Dress is a show-stopping option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This is my dream wedding guest dress — Marianna Hewitt wore this dress in a pale lavender to Sophia Richie’s wedding and I can’t stop thinking about it,” she said. “This is fun for a fashion-forward couple and black-tie dress code.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The dress itself is made of crepe and designed to fit loosely, so it’s a particularly comfortable option. Meanwhile, the feathers and one-shoulder details give it a romantic flair. “Romantic dresses are amongst must-have styles for summer occasions with a modern take on feminine frills in long lengths and ethereal materials,” Bellman points out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Crepe |<strong> Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Size: </strong>0-16</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-hutch-colorblocked-bow-tie-maxi-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hutch Colorblocked Bow-Tie Maxi Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie Hutch Colorblocked Bow-Tie Maxi Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/n_hWb1ZOMEKtV9RFA0ruJpKmZVY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hutch-bow-tie-maxi-dress-bf8a321df9694b08aef291be83a015f4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s lightweight and breathable but black-tie-appropriate, too.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">NYC-based fashion expert Michelle Blashka calls this bow-tie dress from Hutch “the ultimate strapless black dress,” adding, “It’s so versatile — it can easily be dressed up for black tie formals with a touch of bling, or dressed-down as needed.” Made of cotton, the dress will feel breathable, yet it looks particularly high-end and “fashion-forward,” as López puts it, thanks to the bow accent and ruffle hem that will work well for cocktail, beach, formal, and black-tie weddings alike. Plus, it even has pockets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We appreciate that it comes in an inclusive size range, with options for straight, plus, and petite sizes.

This beautiful cotton A-line dress — which is sold in petite and standard sizes — features a pleated bodice and a smocked upper back, plus a rayon lining to ensure it doesn’t stick or look see-through in any type of light. Logistics aside, what makes this silhouette really stand out is the exaggerated off-the-shoulder ruffled neckline. Shoppers do say that the dress runs a bit large, especially for those with a smaller chest size, so keep that in mind as you go to purchase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton |<strong> Colors: </strong>5<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>Standard and petite sizes XXS to XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-on-amazon-zalalus-womens-sexy-one-shoulder-bodycon-formal-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best on Amazon</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zalalus Women's Sexy One Shoulder Bodycon Formal Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Zalalus Women's Sexy One Shoulder Bodycon Formal Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ml4nVSuLSLhOmyadFWvhEHfdiic=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/zalalus-womens-sexy-one-shoulder-bodycon-formal-dress-5b08b360412f4cd1b8514ae145c44933.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a form-fitting formal dress that works especially well for cocktail attire.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The material isn’t the highest quality in terms of longevity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While many of the best wedding guest dresses are a bit of an investment, there are plenty of highly-rated, more-affordable styles out there, like this form-fitting piece we found on Amazon. Made of polyester, this dress may not feel like the most luxe garment in the world (and it may not last the longest), but its chic cutout detailing on the shoulder strap and flattering gathered waist and front slit make it a shoe-in style wise — especially if you’re on a budget or time crunch. Speaking of the latter, if you find that you’ve waited a long time to actually find a wedding guest dress, you’ll be glad to know that this beauty takes just a few days to ship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester |<strong> Colors: </strong>17<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>S-XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-summer-weddings-bec--bridge-moon-dance-strapless-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Summer Weddings</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bec + Bridge Moon Dance Strapless Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bec + Bridge Moon Dance Strapless Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ukJfm8pvD1h3IRW39ablQqqXack=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bec-Bridge-Moon-Dance-Strapless-Dress-93407306990140c2b72cb656258b5bc0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bec + Bridge</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s simple, stunning, and sold in 20 colors.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You can’t wear a bra with it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This strapless dress from Bec + Bridge might look familiar; that’s because Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid wore it while bridesmaids in Lauren Perez’s wedding in November 2021. The sleek viscose dress has a fitted-yet-relaxed silhouette of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>slip dress</a> that’s minimalist and undeniably chic. While it’s been worn in many weddings, the silhouette — which is sold in nearly two dozen colors — can just as easily be worn by guests (so long as you don’t opt for one of the paler, whiter shades). It’s dry clean only, which means it will require extra TLC to keep it looking its best, especially if you plan to wear it in the dead of summer. And on that note, while viscose is breathable, satiny finishes can show even the slightest bit of sweat, so López doesn’t recommend the fabric for extremely hot outdoor destinations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We will warn you, though, the dress cannot be worn with a bra underneath because of the clingy material and drapey back. But secure some good <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>boob tape</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>nipple covers</a> and you’ll be good to go without a worry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Viscose |<strong> Colors: </strong>20<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>2-14</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fall-weddings-lulus-put-on-a-smile-burgundy-floral-print-satin-wrap-maxi-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fall Weddings</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lulu’s Put on a Smile Burgundy Floral Print Satin Wrap Maxi Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lulu&amp;acirc;s Put on a Smile Burgundy Floral Print Satin Wrap Maxi Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6C8ojwBIVEn4V_tKcvJfy6n2dt4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lulus-put-on-a-smile-burgundy-floral-dress-298a50a2a5da4a85a59e347515fae526.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Luluâs</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s sold in the prettiest fall color palette and features a tailorable wrap silhouette.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s only sold in two colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fall weddings tend to be a bit chillier but not necessarily cold, so it’s nice to have a breathable, long-sleeve dress to bridge the gap — and this dress is just that. The wrap nature of the dress gives it a deep V neckline and high slit depending on how you tie it. What’s more, it has flowy, balloon sleeves and it’s sold in the prettiest floral print perfect for fall. As much as we love the warm color palette the print is sold in, we’d love to see more than two colors offered. Still, we say it’s a great, more-affordable pick to consider.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester |<strong> Colors: </strong>2<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>XS-XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-winter-weddings-jenny-yoo-issa-velvet-off-the-shoulder-velvet-column-gown></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Winter Weddings</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jenny Yoo Issa Velvet Column Gown</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Woman wearing Jenny Yoo Issa Velvet Off-The-Shoulder Velvet Column Gown" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mIz3nfK8MfgFpZm0XB5C28x-aWg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jenny-Yoo-Issa-Velvet-Dress-5b9e862fb9b54f20834ae6cb741befaf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The velvet material is warm, rich, and luxurious, making it perfect for winter.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s dry clean only.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you could absolutely wear a long-sleeve dress to a winter wedding, may we suggest opting for a velvet off-the-shoulder silhouette instead? The heavier fabric on this Jenny Yoo dress will keep you warm, but in the event that you do catch a chill easily, it pairs beautifully with faux fur shawls, as López recommends, which look even more fitting during winter. This dress is more fitted in nature, making it easier to layer, and features only slight stretch. It has a side slit, invisible back zipper, and a sheer polyester lining to ensure it doesn’t cling. Additionally, it’s sold in standard and plus sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Velvet polyester |<strong> Colors: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>0-26</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-spring-weddings-anthropologie-the-somerset-maxi-dress-cutwork-edition></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Spring Weddings</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anthropologie The Somerset Maxi Dress: Cutwork Edition</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie The Somerset Maxi Dress: Cutwork Edition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LvKYH72EZsSSiKb60HROFiRVJvc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anthropologie-the-somerset-maxi-dres-bc8642fc99de4bec8dd59dfda0ce1df7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s made with breathable cotton but doesn’t look super casual thanks to the cinched A-line silhouette and delicate cutwork.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You won’t be able to get away with this dress at a formal wedding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This summer season, we're seeing a returned emphasis on the waistline so look for modern fit and flares that cinch or nip the waist,” Bellman says, which is why she points us to this dress at Anthropologie. “This easy cotton dress can be dressed up or down and would look amazing at a garden or daytime wedding,” Blashka says. And we agree. She calls out the lace details and pockets as two stand-out features, but we’re most impressed by its breathable cotton material that works particularly well for casual, summer, and cocktail weddings. “I’d style her with a strappy sandal and a statement bag for a pop,” Blashka adds. You probably won’t be able to wear this at a formal wedding, but you’ll be able to rewear it at work, so you’ll definitely get your money’s worth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton |<strong> Colors: </strong>7<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>XXS-3X (including petite sizes)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beach-weddings-farm-rio-yellow-macaw-bloom-maxi-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Beach Weddings</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FARM Rio Yellow Macaw Bloom Maxi Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FARM Rio Yellow Macaw Bloom Maxi Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/P1aYURz8KYo-HUNobkraFBzAHd4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/farm-rio-yellow-macaw-bloom-maxi-dress-d1742a6a2b93433ba4ae14d7bfb061ef.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Farm Rio</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The vivid, statement-making silhouette.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You have to hand-wash it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Oversized florals and tropical prints work perfectly for both garden parties and beach weddings alike,” Bellman says.

To make it even easier on us, she suggests the Mac Duggal Indy A-Line Ruffled Back-Lace Chiffon Gown. From the lace-up back and built-in bust support to the ruffle-hemmed straps and hem, it's a romantic dream of a dress — and sold in a bunch of colors, no less.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the price tag on this dress is admittedly steep on top of being dry clean only, it’s important to keep in mind that black-tie weddings are higher end, so investing in a dress that you can wear to many formal events to come can certainly be seen as a good investment.

Instead, it means sticking to more laid-back materials — cotton or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>linen dresses</a>, for example — but still embracing wedding-worthy silhouettes. With this in mind, we love the look of the Dissh Harper Black Linen Midi Dress.

Think: lace-up espadrille sandals, gemstone or metallic accents (such as on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kurt Geiger London Orson Crystal Slide Sandal</a>), a padded headband (like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lele Sadoughi Lagoon Sea Life Crystal Headband</a>), and so on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Linen |<strong> Colors: </strong>2<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>2-12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cocktail-sabina-musayev-x-revolve-hermione-mini-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cocktail</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sabina Musayev x REVOLVE Hermione Mini Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sabina Musayev x REVOLVE Hermione Mini Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/47XV6L8U5im_b1cr4tRI0pg_U9c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sabina-musayev-x-revolve-hermione-mini-dress-b9b9e538742948dd9a3117bc01c6047c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The shimmery plisse fabric is a cocktail-themed dream.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s hand wash only.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cocktail wedding attire is especially fun because it calls for shorter lengths and more head-turning accents, such as feathers, gemstones, sequins, and more. So, if you’re looking for a cocktail dress, don’t be afraid to go bold — after all, López says bright colors and metallic accents are in. With that in mind, check out the Sabina Musayev x Revolve Hermione Mini Dress. The mid-thigh, long-sleeve dress features a deep V-neckline, cinched waist, and tiered skirt, all of which make for a head-turning wedding guest dress option. And that Very Berry color?

Because of this, many, many floral dresses exist. That said, we love the vast variety of floral prints at ASTR The Label. Particularly, the Victoriana One Shoulder Floral Midi Dress stands out, with its flutter sleeve and zig-zag ruffle skirt accent. Plus, it's more modest in nature, so it will work well for a variety of dress codes, as well as brunch, bridal showers, and other events.

As our fashion experts mentioned, cotton and linen tend to be best for casual, beach, and summer weddings, while elevated fabrics like silk, crepe, velvet, and chiffon may be better suited for more elevated weddings, as well as those held in spring, fall, and winter.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can I wear the same dress to more than one wedding?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes. “Not only should you feel comfortable wearing the same dress to more than one wedding, but it should be encouraged as we're shopping more consciously these days,” Bellman says. “If you have several weddings on the docket this summer season, look for a dress you can change up easily by switching out the accessories and shoes. Also, look for dresses that have enough versatility that you could wear them beyond just special occasions. I love the challenge of dressing down a party dress for multiple wears.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What colors should I avoid wearing as a wedding guest?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The general rule of thumb is to not wear white to a wedding. That said, there are many variations of white, and many prints—especially those suitable for spring and summer—feature white in the background. “When it comes to wedding guest dresses, my rule of thumb is; if you have to ask, the answer probably is no,” Blashka says. “It’s best to avoid white or any color that translates as white or bridal.” As she sees it, there are plenty of other colors, prints, and styles to choose from.

The big thing to keep in mind is that, just because a wedding might be casual, doesn’t mean that casual shoes like sneakers, Crocs, or Birks are suitable, López says.
