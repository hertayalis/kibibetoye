He started his music career in 2013, and a series of mixtapes helped him become well-known in the Southern music industry. With the release of his singles "Miss It" and "Ice on My Baby" from the mixtape Investments 4, which featured guest performances from YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Yung Bleu made a comeback in 2017. He later made remixes of "Miss It" and "Ice on My Baby" in 2018 with Kid Ink and Kevin Gates, respectively.<p>Yung Bleu's final recordings for Columbia Records and Bad Azz Music were the mixtape Inv 5 and the EP Bleu Vandross, both of which were released in 2020. The EP Love Scars: The 5 Stages of Emotions was released the same year after he obtained deals with Empire Distribution and Dream Chasers Records. The EP included Drake's remix of the Canadian rapper and singer's single "You're Mines Still," which peaked at number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100. Love Scars: The 5 Stages of Emotions by Yung Bleu was able to climb the Billboard 200 chart as a result.</p><p>The songs "Thieves in Atlanta" with Coi Leray, "Baddest" with Chris Brown and 2 Chainz, and "Way More Close (Stuck in a Box)" with Big Sean were all released by Yung Bleu in 2021. His debut album Moon Boy, which was published on July 23, 2021, contained all three of the tracks. Drake, Gunna, Kehlani, and more artists make cameos on the album as special guests.</p><p>The lead single from Yung Bleu's second studio album Tantra, which was released on November 11 of the same year, was "Love in the Way" with Nicki Minaj.

They perhaps may accept lower fees too. If you are seriously interested in booking Yung Bleu or other talent shown on our site, we will research their desire and the specific fee for your live-streaming event or project request.</p><p>Yung Bleu's current work schedule and location in relation to your event's type, date, budget, and locality will play a primary factor in the acceptance of booking Yung Bleu for your party.

After we consult with them, we will provide a personal and accurate quote that includes: final costs, availability, and actual interest in being hired for your specific event or party.</p><p>CTI can give you the accurate Yung Bleu booking price once we submit your event details to their camp. "How much does it cost to book Yung Bleu for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final Yung Bleu booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Yung Bleu charge for an event. An example fee to book Yung Bleu is in the starting range of $25,000-$39,999. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Yung Bleu for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the Yung Bleu agent on your behalf if your funding is in place. By not having funding ready then it will more difficult to book Yung Bleu, because they get many offers to work events that are at or above asking price. It is also important to consider the travel costs when researching the Yung Bleu booking fee, as additional expenses like this, as well as an entourage of staff and equipment, are not necessarily built-in to the booking fee range shown. If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired. We do not personally speak for Yung Bleu, but in our experience in booking talent for over 25 years, this is generally the outcome of inadequate funding.</p><p><b>Type</b><br>Performer</p><p><b>Style</b><br>Rap-Hip Hop</p><p><b>Range</b><br>R&B, Rap-Hip Hop, Male, Age Group-18-30's, African American, American</p><b>Bookmark and Share</b><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaK4xKerZ6aVqXy0rcypo56skaGyr8COa3BucGFkxra6xmaZpZ2lZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsampletalent.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./it-appears-cbs-is-no-longer-available.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./it-appears-cbs-is-no-longer-available.html>It appears CBS is no longer available - The Young and the Restless</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-did-abigail-leave-days-of-our-lives.html>Why Did Abigail Leave 'Days of Our Lives'?
