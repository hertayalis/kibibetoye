TJ Maxx’s Return Policy enables consumers to return their products within 40 days of the date of online purchase and 30 days of the date of store purchase, whichever comes first, according to the company.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>People have also inquired as to whether they may return anything purchased from HomeGoods to TJ Maxx.</h3><p>If you purchased anything from HomeGoods, you may return it to a TJ Maxx store. It may, however, need a little more effort. When an item is returned to TJ Maxx from another TJX entity, a new TJ Maxx tag must be created for the item that was previously purchased from TJX. As a result, the quick answer is yes, although it may take a bit longer than anticipated.</p><p>You may only return to TJ Maxx a certain number of times without a receipt, as well. 30 days are allotted. Items purchased from TJ Maxx may be returned or exchanged within 30 days of the date of purchase if they are in their original condition. Returns with a receipt (and often without a receipt) received after 30 days will be issued a shop credit for the item’s current selling price.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to spend a Marshalls gift card at TJ Maxx, to put it simply?</h3><p>It is true that a Marshalls gift card may be used at any retail location controlled by The TJX Companies, Inc.
