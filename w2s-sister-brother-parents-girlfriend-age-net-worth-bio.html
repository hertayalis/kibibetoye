<time>11 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Given its huge and still huge fanbase, W2S easily belongs to the class of the most successful UK YouTubers.&nbsp;The career that began at a young age not only made him famous;&nbsp;the guy’s fortunes have soared over the years.&nbsp;Known in some circles as Wroetoshaw, W2S’ birth name is Harold Christopher George “Harry” Lewis.&nbsp;He is celebrated as the youngest member of The Sidemen (a group of seven British YouTubers) and admired for the energy and vibes he expresses in his videos.</span></p><p><span>W2S has always done things that earn it the public’s attention – for good and bad reasons, let’s dwell on the latter for a bit.&nbsp;Once upon a time, he forced his followers to peek at his butt as he shared a naked photo of himself.&nbsp;Those who asked, “what was he thinking”?&nbsp;dropped their jaws when photos of his scrotum appeared on his Twitter account.&nbsp;It was soothing to hear that the account had been hacked, but the fact that he had pictures of his testicles on the phone kept people asking the question again: what was he thinking?&nbsp;The case didn’t get any better when the YouTuber proclaimed it was his balls.</span></p><p><span>Another example was when he had everyone believing he had acquired a Ferrari 458;&nbsp;it was November 2014. Shortly after, he confessed that the rose gold tinted car was not his and that he had only repackaged the car he had borrowed to give it the rose gold color .&nbsp;All in all, W2S is a jolly fellow, and there’s a lot to know about him.&nbsp;Find answers to frequently asked questions about it below.</span></p><h2><strong><span>W2S Bio (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>British YouTuber was born on November 24th and November 1996. It is known that his birthplace was in Alderney and he was raised there until his family moved to Guernsey;&nbsp;Harry was only seven at the time.&nbsp;In the Channel Islands, he became one of the students of Guernsey Grammar School.</span></p><p><span>How W2S Became a FIFA Soccer Video Game Fan Not exaggerated, he played football with a team called Rangers FC when he was in high school.&nbsp;Now known for his FIFA match videos, his YouTube channel WROETOSHAW, active since July 26, 2012, managed to garner nearly 4 billion views and 14 million subscribers in March 2019. It’s not the only channel he runs, he also W2SPlays where he plays a variety of games.&nbsp;This channel was premiered on July 7, 2013 and has amassed over 62.5 million views alongside almost 1.2 million subscribers.</span></p><p><span>Given the success of his YouTube project, it’s hard to blame him for dropping out of college to focus on video games and sharing them on the internet.&nbsp;Yes, W2S left school at 17 and moved to London to become a proper YouTuber.&nbsp;Whenever he decides to go back to school, there is no doubt that he will find his way easily.&nbsp;According to reports, he was a very bright student.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What is his net worth?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Various numbers have been cited as Harry’s net over the years and ranges from $5 million to $12 million.&nbsp;While we couldn’t substantiate any of those amounts, it’s not hard to believe he’s worth more than that, considering the millions of people who subscribe to his channels.</span></p><p><span>In 2015, he gave away between £800 and £16 to his Twitter followers – who achieved A*-A suites in GCSEs.&nbsp;The same year, he acquired an apartment in Guernsey.&nbsp;this is also the year he is said to have bought his 50th anniversary edition Lamborghini Gallardo.</span></p><h2><strong><span>W2S sister, brother and parents</span></strong></h2><p><span>While almost nothing is known about his parents, it is believed that they are partly responsible for their son’s passion for games.&nbsp;As the story progressed, they introduced him to the gaming world by gifting him a Nintendo GameCube.&nbsp;YouTuber is not the only child of his parents, he has a younger sister and brother, Rosie and Josh.</span></p><p><span>The former is the oldest of her two siblings, she was born on September 1, 1999 and has been featured in a number of her brother’s videos.&nbsp;Born on December 3, 2001, Josh chose to put himself in his brother’s shoes.&nbsp;He is also a YouTuber and his channel (Joshlewisgsy) has over 60.6 million views and nearly 898 subscribers as of March 2019.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is his girlfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>As far as we know, Katie Sarah Leach is the love of W2S life.&nbsp;It was in 2014 that the YouTuber named her his lover.&nbsp;A few years later, she appeared in one of his videos.&nbsp;It is believed to still be an object, but we have not been able to authenticate it.</span></p><p class=postsid
