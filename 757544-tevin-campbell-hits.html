Out of his many hits, here are the most unforgettable songs Tevin Campbell has ever released.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-3-i-m-ready-1993>3. “I’m Ready” (1993)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On October 26, 1993,&nbsp;Campbell released his critically acclaimed sophomore album,&nbsp;I’m Ready.
