<time>24 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p style=text-align:justify>Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis Presley’s only child with Priscilla Presley, died on January 12 at the age of 54. “It is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us,” Priscilla, 77, confirmed in a statement. “She was the most passionate strong and loving woman I have ever known. We ask for privacy as we try to deal with this profound loss. Thank you for the love and prayers. At this time there will be no further comment.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Days prior to her hospitalization, Lisa Marie attended the 2023 Golden Globes with her mother. They were present when Austin Butler took home an acting award for playing Elvis in the Baz Luhrmann biopic of the same name. Lisa Marie is survived by three of her children, which&nbsp;came from two of her four marriages. Her only son, Benjamin, died in 2020. Last year, Lisa Marie opened up about the “horrific reality” of grief’s “unrelenting grips” in an&nbsp;essay for People.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Lisa Marie’s three daughters will inherit Graceland, a spokesman for the Memphis, Tennessee, estate has confirmed to TODAY in January. Lisa Marie inherited the mansion when her father died when she was 9. Graceland will also be the site for a memorial to Lisa Marie. <strong>“Riley, Harper, Finley, and Priscilla</strong> are grateful for the support, well-wishes, and outpouring of love honoring their beloved Lisa Marie,” a family spokesman said while announcing news of the memorial. <strong>Below, learn more about what Lisa Marie said about motherhood, her approach to parenting and her four children.</strong></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Riley Keough</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Riley Keough, 33, is Lisa Marie’s oldest child, and first from her marriage to musician Danny Keough. Lisa Marie, in her lifetime, was also married to&nbsp;Michael Jackson,&nbsp;Nicolas Cage&nbsp;and musician Michael Lockwood, with whom she shares twins.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Riley is an accomplished actor who will star in the upcoming series “Daisy Jones and the Six,” a role that involves singing. Despite being born into a show business family and following their path, Keough said she wasn’t raised in the spotlight.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Speaking to&nbsp;Nylon Magazine&nbsp;in 2016, for her breakout role in “The Girlfriend Experience,” Riley spoke about her mom’s parenting style.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“She was like, ‘I don’t want you growing up like another Hollywood celebrity daughter.’ She was so not about that life, you know? She didn’t really put attention on it. It was there. We’d get photographed doing stuff, but I didn’t see a tabloid until I was 15.”</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-52853"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lisa-Marie-Presley-Children.jpg alt="Lisa Marie Presley Children" width=1200 height=628 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p style=text-align:justify>“I didn’t want her to have that shadow where she felt competition and intimidated by anything,” Lisa Marie said, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>People</a>. ‘I wanted (my children) to be able to do what they wanted to do.” When it came to co-parenting with ex-husband Danny, Lisa Marie said the two stayed “civilized” in an interview with People&nbsp;in 2005. “Ultimately this is a good message to send out to people: You don’t have to put your crap on your kids even if you are not together. You can still be civilized. I knew at the age that I had the kids with him that Danny was someone I could be connected with for the rest of my life. I knew he would be a good father,” she said.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Riley is married to stuntman Ben Smith-Petersen, whom she met while filming “Mad Max: Fury Road,” per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a>.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Two years after the death of her brother, Riley shared a photo of them standing together at her 2015 wedding. “Not an hour goes by where I don’t think of you and miss you. It’s been two years today since you left and I still can’t believe you’re not here. You are so loved my Ben Ben,” Riley&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>wrote</a>&nbsp;in the caption.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Riley Keough (@rileykeough)</a></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Benjamin Keough</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Benjamin Keough was Lisa Marie and Danny Keough’s younger child.

He was the love of her life.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>The year prior to her son’s death, Lisa Marie posted a photo of her with her four children. “Mama Lion with cubs,”&nbsp;she captioned&nbsp;the black-and-white family photo.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Lisa Marie Presley (@lisampresley)</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>In the comments, Instagram users noticed the resemblance between Benjamin and his grandfather, Elvis Presley.

Everybody was grabbing him for a photo because it is just uncanny.
