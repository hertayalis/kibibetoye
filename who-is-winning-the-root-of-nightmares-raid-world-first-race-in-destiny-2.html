If you use them, their effects will not work in The Root of Nightmares Raid, and their power level will be significantly lower than the cap. Use them at your own risk.</p><p>The Bungie team will officially announce the winner of The World First race from their Twitter page. Even though some players may have seen an official team make it through a specific time, it’s not over until Bungie has made the official announcement.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
