She started philanthropy in 2023 to further her initiative toward society.</p><p>She has partnered with the “Adopt Don’t Shop” effort to help close down pet shops across Colorado and urge people to adopt stray dogs as part of her social responsibility endeavors.</p><p>From 1983 through 1998, her retired husband John Elway played professionally for the Denver Broncos exclusively and even won two Super Bowls.</p><p>He served as an executive after retiring and has been a consultant for the Denver Broncos since 2022. He has made sizable charitable contributions to the Colorado area as well.</p><p>John and Paige have been dating for more than 15 years. The pair got engaged in 2008 after a year of dating, and they were wed on August 29, 2009.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Childhood, family, and education</h2><p>Social activist and former cheerleader Paige Green was of white heritage and was born on January 2, 1967.</p><p>She was raised in Denver, Colorado, but was born in Seattle, Washington, in the United States.</p><p>Capricorn by astrological sign, Paige Green is 56 years old. She weighs 130 lbs. and is 1.68 m tall. She has dark brown hair and brown eyes.</p><p>Green has been silent about her parents, though. Her early years and stories from her youth are unknown.</p><p>However, there is no additional information about her siblings or her early life; even her academic background is kept secret from the public.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career</h2><p>Paige became an NFL cheerleader for the Oakland Raiders because she has always been attracted by sports.</p><p>Despite having established a successful career, her charitable giving and social service appear to go above and beyond what is anticipated.</p><p>Green is an animal rights activist who has teamed up with the “Adopt Don’t Shop” campaign to help shut down pet stores throughout Colorado.</p><p>She even worked together with certain local Denver animal rights groups, such as the South Platte Valley and the Humane Society’s Colorado Citizens for dog welfare.</p><p>She co-hosted the first “Bowl n’ Bark” event in December 2014 with Anna Welker and her wife, with the hope that it would improve dog care.</p><p>She recognised and addressed the fact that saving and sheltering animals is crucial for their welfare.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ex-boyfriend, Spouse, & Children</h2><p>Paige and Reagan Dunn, Jennifer Dunn’s son, were engaged in 2006. However, their relationship was short-lived.</p><p>Eventually, she fell in love with John Elway, an NFL player who is now her husband.</p><p>Although though she and Elway had first met in 2005 at Marcus Allen’s golf tournament in Los Angeles, their relationship wouldn’t start up until much later.</p><p>In September 2008, John, a former quarterback for the Broncos, proposed to Paige Green while they were on vacation in Venice, Italy.</p><p>On August 29, 2009, the pair exchanged vows in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. Craig Andrisen, Tim Schmidt, and sportswriter Rick Reilly were among the attendees.</p><p>In addition to playing football, Elway is one of Denver’s most well-known benefactors. In fact, at the Carousel Ball for the Children’s Diabetes Foundation in October 2015, he received a Tribute Award in his honor.</p><p>Even though Paige and John have been married for more than 7 years, there is no information on their children.</p><p>Although divorcing Janet Elway in 2003, John Elway wed her in 1984.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Salary, Net Worth, and Career Earnings</h2><p>Paige joined the Oakland Raiders’ cheerleaders as a team promotion.</p><p>She must have made that much per year because Oakland cheerleaders make, on average, $75,000 per year.</p><p>She has other unspecified sources of income in other industries, nevertheless.</p><p>Over the course of her career, Paige Green has earned a respectable sum of money. As of 2023, she has a net worth of about $1 million.</p><p>In contrast, her husband John Elway, who earns $3 million a year in salary, has a net worth of around $145 million.</p><p>As a quarterback for the Broncos, he made over $25 million in pay, with $45 million in total earnings over 16 seasons.</p><p>He has the most costly collection of automobiles in the world, which includes a Mercedes-Benz S55AMG.</p><p>The couple is content in their enormous, seven-bedroom Englewood home, which is worth $5.81 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Husband Ernie Elway</h2><p>John Elway, the spouse of Paige Green, is a well-known former American football player who competed for the Denver Broncos and won two Super Bowls (1998 and 1999).</p><p>At Stanford University, John played football and baseball and was a part of the fraternity Delta Tau Delta.</p><p>He was taken in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Colts, although he was later traded to the Denver Broncos.</p><p>Elway had one of the best winning percentages in NFL history and was recognized as one of the best quarterbacks.</p><p>Additionally, he has 148 victories to his name, built a stellar resume over the course of his career, and had an immense influence on football.</p><p>Elway served as general manager from 2011 until 2020 after retiring in 1998.</p><p>After that, he started serving as a consultant with the Denver Broncos in 2022 and makes a positive impact on society.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq2fnmWcnrOmedKtpquxXaSzbrbOoaVmnZysrrp5waKmoKqRpbW6ec2eq2avn6fBqXnMqKmeZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-life-story-of-john-elway-biography-net-worth-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-life-story-of-john-elway-biography-net-worth-more.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-life-story-of-john-elway-biography-net-worth-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-life-story-of-john-elway-biography-net-worth-more.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-life-story-of-john-elway-biography-net-worth-more.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-life-story-of-john-elway-biography-net-worth-more.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./allan-houston-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./allan-houston-net-worth-2024.html>Allan Houston Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pete-townshend-net-worth.html>Pete Townshend Net Worth: Music, Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pete-townshend-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
