They finished the previous season in the 2021-22 season.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-preview><strong>Preview:</strong></h4><p>Angers are gearing up for their eighth straight season in Ligue 1 after finishing seven points above the three teams that finished worst in the standings in the previous year.</p><p>The hosts on Saturday lost players like Mohamed-Ali Cho and Angelo Fulgini over the summer, but they brought in new players like Cedric Hountondji and Adrien Hunou, who came from Clermont Foot and Minnesota, respectively. Other players like Angelo Fulgini and Mohamed-Ali Cho left the team.</p><p>They have been busy on the pitch as well as in the transfer market, having played in seven pre-season friendly. While they have been busy in the transfer market, they have also been busy in the transfer market.</p><p>They finished their pre-season with a crushing 6-0 loss to Sevilla before drawing 2-2 with Serie A opponents Spezia. Three of those seven matches ended in a victory for the team.</p><p>Angers have the opportunity to earn three consecutive home victories in Ligue 1 for the first time since September 2019, when they won their final two home league games of the previous season.</p><p>In the meantime, Nantes had a very successful season in the previous campaign, which resulted in them winning their first major title since the year 2001.</p><p>They were able to secure a respectable ninth-place finish, but their outstanding performance in the league was eclipsed by a remarkable run in the cup competition.</p><p>A penalty kick by Ludovic Blas was all that was needed to give Nantes the victory in the Coupe de France final over Nice. Antoine Kombouare was the hero for his team, which went on to win the trophy.</p><p>As a result of their cup victory, Nantes was invited to compete in the French Super Cup, which took place over the past weekend. Despite their best efforts, however, they were unable to prevent Paris Saint-Germain from handing them a heartbreaking 4-0 loss.</p><p>The team that will be playing on Sunday will try to put their loss in the Super Cup behind them as they compete against Angers in the hopes of extending their winning streak against them to five matches.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-news><strong>Team news</strong></h4><p>Due to a hamstring injury, the hosts will also be without the participation of Sofiane Boufal, who won the competition during the previous season.</p><p>Hountondji will make his debut for Angers in a competitive match, and it is possible that the 28-year-old will start with Miha Blazic in the center of the defense.</p><p>Hunou, who joined the club over the summer, is also scheduled to make his debut for the organization on Sunday when the home team is slated to play as the offensive leader.</p><p>As for the away team, they won’t be able to call on Charles Traore because he is out with a long-term injury, and they won’t be able to use Jean-Charles Castelletto since he received a red card in the loss to the Super Cup and is suspended as a result.</p><p>In the event that Castelletto is unable to play, Dennis Appiah may be asked to play in a back three, and Fabio may be asked to replace Appiah in the left wing-back position.</p><p>Mostafa Mohamed, who joined Nantes in the summer and made his debut in the second half of the game the week before, will likely get the opportunity to start for the first time on Sunday.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-following-players-could-start-for-angers><strong>The following players could start for Angers:</strong></h4><p>Mendy, Ounahi, Capelle; Sima, Thioub, and Bernardoni; Sabanovic, Hountondji, Blazic, and Doumbia</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nantes-probable-starting-lineup><strong>Nantes probable starting lineup:</strong></h4><p>Lafont; Appiah, Pallois, Girotto; Coco, Chirivella, Sissoko, Blas, Silva; Simon, Mohamed</p><p>Angers has the benefit of playing at home, but Nantes hasn’t lost to Saturday’s opponents in any of the last four encounters between the two teams, and we predict that Nantes will earn a point during their away game on Sunday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usrZ6bvK2wjZympmegp7K3tcSwZJqml5q%2FtHnVrGSnmZ6psrR5z6ucnaGTqbawuoytnJqlXaOyuL%2BMpaCnnaWlwHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpreview-angers-vs-nantes-prediction-team-news-lineups.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpreview-angers-vs-nantes-prediction-team-news-lineups.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpreview-angers-vs-nantes-prediction-team-news-lineups.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpreview-angers-vs-nantes-prediction-team-news-lineups.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpreview-angers-vs-nantes-prediction-team-news-lineups.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpreview-angers-vs-nantes-prediction-team-news-lineups.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./verizon-will-be-absent-from-galaxy-s-ii-reveal.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./verizon-will-be-absent-from-galaxy-s-ii-reveal.html>Verizon Will Be Absent From Galaxy S II Reveal</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./intermittent-fasting-benefits.html>Intermittent Fasting Benefits Modern Honey</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./intermittent-fasting-benefits.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
